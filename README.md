This is a command-line based travel assistant tool designed to help users quickly generate a personalized packing checklist based on their travel plan. By entering destination type (e.g., beach, mountain, city, cold), number of travel days, and departure date, the program intelligently recommends essential items, appropriate clothing quantities, and destination-specific supplies.

The tool streamlines the pre-trip preparation process and allows flexible checklist management. Users can:

View their checklist and mark items as packed

Add or remove custom items to meet personal needs

Review items that are still unpacked to avoid missing anything

Reset packed status to re-check luggage from scratch

Get a summary of all items, packed count, and remaining count

Check how many days are left until the trip starts

Use the menu command at any time to bring up the available options
